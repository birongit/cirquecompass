    <p>New York City isn‚Äôt just a concrete jungle ‚Äî it‚Äôs also a jungle gym full of hoops, silks, and spinning poles in
      every district. Whether you‚Äôre visiting for a few days or doing a full-on traincation, these studio picks will
      keep your feet off the ground and your body moving. Here are my favorite places to train circus-style in the Big
      Apple:</p>

        <p>Bright, airy, and full of style, Incredipole is a Brooklyn gem known for its beautiful natural light and
          strong
          community vibe. The focus here is mostly on pole, but you‚Äôll find lyra (hoop) classes as well. The instructors
          are
          supportive and creative, and the space is <em>Instagram gold</em>. If you're looking for quality instruction

        <p>Located just blocks away from Body & Pole, Aerial Arts NYC offers a wide variety of apparatuses: from lyra,
          silks, and straps to trapeze and more. They have classes for all levels and run throughout the day. While the
          space might feel more utilitarian than cozy, it's a solid option for trying out new disciplines or fitting in
          extra training time while you‚Äôre in the city.</p>

        <h3>‚≠ê Bonus: Acro Dance at Broadway Dance Center</h3>
        <p class="location">üìç Manhattan Midtown West</p>
        <p>Not strictly circus, but this one‚Äôs too good not to include. Broadway Dance Center is a NYC institution
          offering dance classes in just about every style imaginable. A great way to cross-train and work on
          those lines. My personal favorite? Acro Dance. It's
          beginner-friendly and a fantastic way to build floorwork vocabulary for your next act ‚Äî think rolls,
          cartwheels,
          and ground transitions in a super supportive all-levels class.</p>
        <div class="teacher-spotlight">
          <p><strong>üí° Teacher Feature:</strong> <em>Sissa Strain</em> makes acro fun and inclusive!
