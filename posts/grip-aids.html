        <p>Whether you're pole dancing or working on a "naked" aerial apparatus like an untaped lyra, grip can be a
            challenge. Too often, what stands between you and a successful move is sweaty hands. Over the years, I have
            experimented with many different products. While every body and skin type is different, here is what works
            for me:</p>

        <h3>Hands</h3>
        <p>Most people struggle with sweaty hands. Especially when nervousness sets in, your hands might start sweating
            before you even touch the pole. Hand grips to the rescue.</p>

        <h4>1. Dry Hands</h4>
        <p>The classic for sweaty hands. Great for pole, but it can dry out your skin with frequent use. I try to keep
            it to a minimum, but it certainly helps in the short term.</p>
        <img src="../images/IMG_3551.jpeg" alt="Dry Hands"
            style="display:block;max-width:320px;width:100%;height:auto;margin:18px auto 28px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);" />

        <h4>2. Tite Grip</h4>
        <p>Good as a pre-grip aid to stop hands from sweating. I apply this early (usually before warm-up) for critical
            sessions, like a showcase or competition.</p>

        <h4>3. Good Old Alcohol Wipes</h4>
        <p>Not a grip aid per se, but keeping your skin and pole clean helps a lot. On hot days, I do this between each
            attempt.</p>

        <h3>Body Grip</h3>
        <p>Body skin can have quite different characteristics. For me, I tend to have very dry skin. Unless I get really
            sweaty, I need a little boost to make my skin stick. Regular lotions often make it too slippery, especially
            when applied less than 24 hours before training. So here is what I use instead:</p>

        <h4>1. Grip + Glow Body Grip - Coming Up Roses</h4>
        <p>My favorite — it is essentially glycerin in a spray bottle with sparkle and fragrance.</p>

        <h4>2. Dew Point</h4>
        <p>Similar to Grip + Glow: a glycerin spray that adds some tackiness to my skin, just without the shine and
            fragrance. This can be a positive for people sensitive to fragrances.</p>
        <img src="../images/IMG_3552.jpeg" alt="Dew Point"
            style="display:block;max-width:320px;width:100%;height:auto;margin:18px auto 28px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);" />

        <h4>3. The Body Shop - Body Yogurt</h4>
        <p>My regular skin care product. Again, it is glycerin-based. I’ve found I can apply it in a modest amount even
            before I go on the pole.</p>
        <img src="../images/IMG_3553.jpeg" alt="The Body Shop - Body Yogurt"
            style="display:block;max-width:320px;width:100%;height:auto;margin:18px auto 28px auto;border-radius:10px;box-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);" />

        <h4>4. iTac2</h4>
        <p>The killer product in case you need to glue yourself to the pole. I see it being used in showcases or
            competitions. Be careful, though — once it sticks it sticks, and it can take some effort to get it off the
            pole again. Your pole cleaners will thank you if you keep it to a minimum.</p>

        <p>Always test products first — everyone’s skin and training context is different!</p>
