        <h2>About Cirque Compass</h2>
        <p>Welcome to your guide to aerial arts around the world — a mix of circus, travel, and all the little lessons
            I’ve picked up along the way. I’m obsessed with flying — literally. Aerial has taken me to new cities,
            connected me with incredible people, and sparked more than a few unexpected adventures.</p>

        <p>
            Cirque Compass is where I share tips, favorite spots, and glimpses into the life of training on the move.
            Whether you're dreaming of running away with the circus or just searching for the best studio while on
            vacation, you’re in the right place.</p>

        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>My goal is to connect the global circus community through shared experience, knowledge, and inspiration.
            Circus isn’t just about tricks— it’s about movement, expression, and belonging in a community that spans
            continents. This platform celebrates the passion, grit, and beauty of circus life — and supports those
            carving their own path, one spin at a time.
        </p>

        <h3>Join the Journey</h3>
        <p>Follow the blog for the latest posts on aerial arts, studio reviews, and travel hacks. Let’s explore — and
            soar — together.
